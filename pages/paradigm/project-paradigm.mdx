### C5 Recap

*Spice and Ken reveal the truth of the Paradigm to Zinc. He reacts nonchalantly to the reveal that brokers are AI and not, in fact, humans unable to return to their cryogenically-frozen bodies. To him, it’s irrelevant. As the only ones who seem to know the truth, they argue over what should be done. Zinc prefers diplomacy, Spice wants to broadcast the news direct to everyone, but it is Ken's suggestion which wins out. Covertly, they organize mass protests which culminate in thousands of brokers and drifters marching on the Merkle Tree - the center of power in Era Novum. With protestors growing increasingly passionate, and Politicians deploying fearsome Samurai to protect themselves, a violent clash seems inevitable.*

### C6 Recap

*The protests erupted into violence at the Merkle Tree when the Samurai held their ground and the protestors fought back. When it became apparent that safe mode has been disabled in Era Novum, the city descended into anarchy. Almost robbed by a wily gambler on her way to find Zinc, Spice managed to outwit him before getting back on the road. Once reconciled, she and Zinc discussed the clash at the Merkle Tree and wondered where Unironic Ken might be. Just as they were about to decide what to do next, Spice was violently torn out of the Paradigm.*

### C7 Recap

*When Spice’s entire compound is kicked out of the Paradigm due to a Failsafe Alpha, she’s certain it’s no accident. As everyone performs their emergency duties, Spice decides to set off into the snow in search of P.O.S.T., a device that will let her send a message back into TPL. Unironic Ken and Zinc receive her message, and it’s shortly followed by another from someone calling themselves ‘The Moderator’. This mysterious figure promises to help, leading them to information regarding a group calling themselves ShaDAO, who are behind the Failsafe Alpha. With the location of the device causing the kick, and only 100 blocks left to destroy it, Ken and Zinc attempt to infiltrate the ShaDAO facility and get Spice back into the Paradigm.*

### Background

**This is the story of The Paradigm Lost. The earth is frozen. Locked in a modern ice age. The world governments had come together with a plan to save humanity by moving everyone into the metaverse. It had been called "The Paradigm Shift." The first ten thousand volunteers, ready to pave the way, were called CyberBrokers. Everything went wrong. Two centuries later, a complacent human race copes with a great awakening.**

**Enter the world of CyberBrokers, a digital art collectibles ecosystem centered around 10,001 unique on-chain NFTs.**
