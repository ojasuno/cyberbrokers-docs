## 10 | Mecha Head: Behemoth Class III

Not built for looks, the Behemoth Class III head is heavily fortified and adept at protecting critical components. The durability that Behemoth parts are known for isn't derived from metallurgy, instead it owes its staying power to raw density.

## 11 | Mecha Head: Lupis Class IV

Complete with match grade sensors and full-spectrum vision, the Lupis Class IV head provides an almost unparalleled view of the battlefield. Weak minds or inexperienced pilots can be overwhelmed by the sensory data and often lock up.
