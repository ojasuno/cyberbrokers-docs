## Token ID: 3 | Mecha Engine: Enforcer Class I

Regarded for being versatile and reliable, the standard-issue Enforcer engine is the hammer of choice for most mech pilots.

## Token ID: 4 | Mecha Engine: Ravager Class II

As fast as they are repairable, with the Ravager engine you can afford to be reckless. A quality engine that can take whatever you throw at it.

## Token ID: 5 | Mecha Engine: Behemoth Class III

Usually burdened by heavily armored mechs, mech pilots should beware putting Behemoth engines on lighter frames. What Behemoths lack in speed, they make up for in unyielding power.

## Token ID: 6 | Mecha Engine: Lupis Class IV

Ultra light and powerful, the Lupis engine’s high-hitting power and speed is only countered by the high skill required to get full use of its power and the high difficulty to obtain it.

## Token ID: 7 | Mecha Engine: Nexus Class V

Built with an indestructible exoskeleton and constructed using superior geometry and design, you won't find a faster or more powerful engine than the Nexus. The exterior shells are coded to mimic ultra hard cold-rolled titanium alloys, making it the most durable and sleek of all the engines.

## Token ID: 10 | Mecha Head: Behemoth Class III

Not built for looks, the Behemoth Class III head is heavily fortified and adept at protecting critical components. The durability that Behemoth parts are known for isn't derived from metallurgy, instead it owes its staying power to raw density.

## Token ID: 11 | Mecha Head: Lupis Class IV

Complete with match grade sensors and full-spectrum vision, the Lupis Class IV head provides an almost unparalleled view of the battlefield. Weak minds or inexperienced pilots can be overwhelmed by the sensory data and often lock up.

## Token ID: 12 | Mecha Head: Nexus Class V

The feature-rich Nexus Class V’s 360-degree visual capabilities are first-in-class with fully integrated Fukutsu AI to maximize piloting potential. With some of the most advanced auto-pilot and targeted systems on the market, pilots can achieve previously unimagined levels of performance.
