# TPL Mecha Part

## Token ID: 1 | Enforcer Model Arm

Scrapped arm of an Enforcer Model TPL Mecha. Salvageable as either right or left attachment.

Scrapped arm of a Lupis Model TPL Mecha. Salvageable as either right or left attachment.


## Token ID: 3 | Mecha Engine: Enforcer Class I

Regarded for being versatile and reliable, the standard-issue Enforcer engine is the hammer of choice for most mech pilots.

## Token ID: 4 | Mecha Engine: Ravager Class II

As fast as they are repairable, with the Ravager engine you can afford to be reckless. A quality engine that can take whatever you throw at it.

## Token ID: 5 | Mecha Engine: Behemoth Class III

Usually burdened by heavily armored mechs, mech pilots should beware putting Behemoth engines on lighter frames. What Behemoths lack in speed, they make up for in unyielding power.

## Token ID: 6 | Mecha Engine: Lupis Class IV

Ultra light and powerful, the Lupis engineâ€™s high-hitting power and speed is only countered by the high skill required to get full use of its power and the high difficulty to obtain it.
