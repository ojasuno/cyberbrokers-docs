## Token ID: 3 | Mecha Engine: Enforcer Class I

Regarded for being versatile and reliable, the standard-issue Enforcer engine is the hammer of choice for most mech pilots.

## Token ID: 4 | Mecha Engine: Ravager Class II

As fast as they are repairable, with the Ravager engine you can afford to be reckless. A quality engine that can take whatever you throw at it.

## Token ID: 5 | Mecha Engine: Behemoth Class III

Usually burdened by heavily armored mechs, mech pilots should beware putting Behemoth engines on lighter frames. What Behemoths lack in speed, they make up for in unyielding power.

## Token ID: 6 | Mecha Engine: Lupis Class IV

Ultra light and powerful, the Lupis engine’s high-hitting power and speed is only countered by the high skill required to get full use of its power and the high difficulty to obtain it.

## Token ID: 7 | Mecha Engine: Nexus Class V

Built with an indestructible exoskeleton and constructed using superior geometry and design, you won't find a faster or more powerful engine than the Nexus. The exterior shells are coded to mimic ultra hard cold-rolled titanium alloys, making it the most durable and sleek of all the engines.

## Token ID: 8 | Mecha Head: Enforcer Class I

Durable and suited for the vast majority of combat zone conditions, the Enforcer Class I head supplies high battlefield visibility without overwhelming the operator’s mind. Trusted for decades by countless mech pilots.

## Token ID: 9 | Mecha Head: Ravager Class II

Built for the discerning mech pilot with a mechanic on speed dial, the Ravager Class II head is fitted with shock absorbers and a 360-degree field of vision. Preferred by fast-twitch pilots and those who don’t mind a bit of head-rolling.
