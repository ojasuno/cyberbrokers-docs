# The Talents of CyberBrokers

## Ad Buddy

Walking down the strip, you may be accosted by an AdBuddy. Do not be afraid. They're really excited to show you all the latest gizmos and gadgets. After all, a discount coupon for the latest Dreamscapes can be a very valuable thing.

## AI

As the first attempts at manmade artificial intelligence, the AI has shown, at times, remarkable indifference set alongside a fierce hatred. Do not let their cuddly appearance lull you into complicity. They are indeed after all of your toys.

## Alien

No one is sure where the these aliens came from. One theory is that they arrived hundreds of years ago on the planet Earth, soon to be hustled to Area 51 where they were hooked up to all manner of overly energetic devices.

## Android

Not all CyberBrokers wished to retain their original physical form as their digital afterimage. In fact, a few decided to shed their fleshy forms and embrace an array of plastic and stainless steel parts. These forms turned out much more resistant to nibbles from the AI.

## Architect

Fact and Faith are the original creators of the world known as The Paradigm Lost. They were the first humans to enter and have never left. Ever since, they have built out opposite ends of the metaverse and are cursed to argue form versus function forever at the space where the two halves collide.

## Assassin

Assassins are relentless about working alone because there can only be one highest bidder. Experts in the dematerialization of their targets, you can bet that if you're on their list, it'll be when your hot wallet is full. Assuming you've anything to left to wager, of course.

## Astronomer

Digital astronomy is as much about the discovery of distant new regions as it is about the explicit manifestation of such. Astronomers are forever exploring the outer limits of where the largest random seeds wield their outsized influence over the far parts of the simulation.

---

## Busker

Powered by pure joy and a smidge of insanity, Buskers can be found entertaining throngs of Drifters throughout TPL with their skills. From busy street corners, to dark clubs along The Strip. The very best are always in demand as high as their volume.

## Cammer

Not all content is created equal. Some is created, splayed across silken sheets, while finding lithe, chordal slopes, and glistening thick with the heavy scent of crushed water lilies and melancholy. All of it captured in hi-res 'grams for a fat stack of coin and your sweaty pleasure.

<Bleed>![cammer](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-cammer.svg)</Bleed>

## Chef

The blood and food may not be real, but Chefs can cook up equisite experiences for their patrons according to the culinary digital arts. From the delicate crunch of a pink lady to the meaty smack of a slab of brisket, you won't miss the runny gruel from your IRL hovel.

<Bleed>![chef](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-chef.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Chemist

Someone needs to parboil those herbs down into usable reagents for your health potion. Particularly when it comes to certain large, industrial vats of purple fluid. And, don't forget, no one wants to d-mez because they didn't adequately tip the Chemist for a bespoke stamina boost.

---

## Cleanup Crew

Primarily Cleanup Crew are employed to repair and upgrade older bits of TPL's simulation assets to newer, more modern standards. Since the world is constantly in motion with new drops and formations, it is a neverending job. Which, of course, makes them very twitchy.

<Bleed>![cleanupcrew](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-cleanupcrew.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Courier

When your data stick absolutely needs to be there on time and handed off in-person, there is no other option than a Courier. And all it'll cost you is two days' wages for fast-travel fees and hazard pay. Delivered in three minutes or it's still not free.

<Bleed>![courier](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-courier.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Cultist

They may seem a little WAGMI from the outside, but they assure us once you peek beneath the surface, there's no unseeing it. You are forever changed. But, it's not as scary as all that. All you need to do is lay out some coin and swap into the black. There's a reason anyone who does, never comes back.

<Bleed>![cultist](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-cultist.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Dealer

Because a TPL Rig is wired directly into the brains of Drifters, there is an enormous opportunity to artificially stimulate the meatspace bundles of axons, increasing mental clarity, focus & cognitive performance. However, not everyone enjoys getting high on their own power supply.

<Bleed>![dealer](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-dealer.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Degen

Digital fanboys and fangirls, flipping out about the next hottest thing can be irritating to some people, but not us. We love looking in the mirror and seeing a Degen. Swimming in endless joy, potential, and optimism. Breathing in deep of that strawberry-flavored hopium. Degen forever.

<Bleed>![degen](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-degen.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Demon

Demons specialize in penetration. Infiltrating and infecting your underlying core systems. When cornered, Demons fight, fangs bared, and slashing before finally vanishing. Rumor has it their goth-black ability even impels PVP features into non-PVP zones where, at any moment, the ground might erupt in wings and talons.

<Bleed>![demon](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-demon.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Dreamer

What happens when lucid dreamers have their brains wired into the metaverse? Viscuous sprays of color and mentation coat the world wherever they wander. Which means the ability to manifest whatever glorious tinsel springs to mind makes them awfully hard to miss at a party.

<Bleed>![dreamer](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-dreamer.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Enforcer

When you're having a large event and need someone to check NFTs at the door, Enforcers are the toons you portal in for the job. They're sturdy, strong, and intimidating, just like your girl's ex-boyfriend. So, don't forget your fat roll of 100s if have been 'mistakenly' left off the list.

<Bleed>![enforcer](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-enforcer.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Gambler

They say professional poker players make the best strategy gamers. It's because the ability to runtime calculate probabilities is an extreme advantage in digital combat. You have to know when to hatchet, know when to run, and always make sure to watch the eyes.

<Bleed>![gambler](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-gambler.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Gargoyle

Trained in everything from packet sniffing to ray casting to sample slicing, these TPL spies are able to record and recreate any situation they witness, anywhere in the metaverse. However, their bulky, beeping gear tends to make it easy to catch them looking over your shoulder.

<Bleed>![gargoyle](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-gargoyle.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Gene Editor

Looking for an extra set of wings for your TPL avatar? They can help. Just, be aware that it will cost you. Probably more than you're willing to pay, and not in the way you're willing to pay for it.

<Bleed>![geneeditor](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-geneeditor.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Gunter

It all began with the use of steganography to hide private keys throughout works of art. From that simple act, an entirely new class of Explorers was born. And, ever since their success with that first easter egg, they've started running in small packs. Gunters are natural puzzle solvers and live to conquer the next quest.

<Bleed>![gunter](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-gunter.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Hacker

Look around you. Everything in TPL is made from code. Hackers hunt from far corner to far corner, querying rough edges for exploits. Sometimes, they'll take commission, but, more than likely, if they're talking to you, be polite. There's a very expensive reason why you should.

<Bleed>![hacker](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-hacker.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Holo

Holos sit at the highest level of communication. Able to wink in and out of any corner in TPL, they make the ideal messengers for the most powerful metaverse denizens. Chances are, if you see one, you probably don't want to be there. For multiple reasons. Run.

<Bleed>![holo](../../public/_assets/_talent-icon/cb-talent-holo.svg)</Bleed>

---

## Incumbent

Behind every successful Politician are dozens of Incumbents. And, it takes dozens to smoothly run an office because their goldfish brains keep forgetting what they were doing every time they enter the room. On the bright side, it means they're pretty worthless to kidnap for information on their bosses. Assuming they even remember who they work for.
